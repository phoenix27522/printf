---> breaking down printf

     prototype: int _printf(const char *format, ...);


     case -1.
       
        *** printf("printing string only")
            if(format != '%") --- > print fromat

    
     case -2.
        
        *** printf("printing if it has specifier %c or d")
          use switch and print it.
     
     try -1(date: 18/08/2023) :- was succesful it printed char and string.
            ### drawbacks the line of code will be large if want to add more specifier
     
     solution:- using structure
